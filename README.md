# Retrieval Augmented Generation Pipeline Built on LangChain Framework

In this repository are is a chatbot built on the open source LangChain framework and served on both stream lit web apps as well as API. The Models include open source models such as Llama 3 and Open AI's GPT 3.5 Turbo. A core component of the application is its RAG pipeline which will take files (both locally stored and from the web) and store the information in a vector store to provide more context to the model. 

Below is a diagram that explains the RAG process succinctly.

## Demo
<!-- This app, hosted via Uvicorn using the LangChain/ LangServe framework, showcases both a closed source model like GPT 3.5 Turbo and an open source model like Llama 3 via Ollama. 
The LangChain frame work allows for a generic, model agnostic framework to be utilized. This allows us to scale and add more models, features, or swap models with ease.
Both APIs can be used simultaneously. Both APIs were configured using the exact same prompt to compare apples to apples.

In the example below, the closed source model- GPT 3.5 Turbo is being interacted with.
